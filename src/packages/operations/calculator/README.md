# How to Use Solver

## Operator Priority

Mathematical operations were conducted based on priority level set as shown in the table below:
| Operator    | Descriptions    | Priority    |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| +           | Addition        | 0           |
| -           | Subtraction     | 0           |
| *           | Multiplication  | 1           |
| /           | Division        | 1           |
| ^           | Exponent        | 2           |

````
A string that constitutes of multiple operators e.g. `2*3 + 3/4^2 -1` will go through the following steps:

`2*3 + 3/16 -1` -> `6 + 0.1875 -1` -> `6 + 0.1875 -1`
